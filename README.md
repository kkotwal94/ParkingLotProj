# Parking Lot Project
A Parking Lot System

A parking lot system programmed in NodeJS, ReactJS, ExpressJS, and templating. I used mongodb for a database. 
This project just randomizes all the users that are signed up with a profile to a parking spot. The slick part is their is a admin 
profile to it. The admin can add violations based off user or vehicle information, the admin can also edit profiles and select slots for
users to stop at. The admin can most importantly add violations and notes, whether they have the user or not. If the user is not determined
when adding a violation, the admin may assign a vehicle a violation, and then a vehicle to a user when they figure it out who the violation belongs to.

The user may do all the same but they cannot edit info like parking lot #, or tag #'s. They can however have multiple vehicles and select the one that is currently in use.
